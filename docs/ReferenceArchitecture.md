##<a name="Goals"></a>Goals

Provide guidance and recommendations on the tools, best practices, standards, constraints and solution design that can/should be used to develop an application SPA (Single Page Application) with angularjs.

##<a name="Foundations"></a>Foundations

* Promoting productivity for projects
* Standardize SPA applications
* Facilitate the training of teams
* Adoption of standards and market practices

##<a name="Target"></a>Target
Mainly applications with AngularJS SPA,Â since it is more widespread, stable and evolving. Presented techniques can mostly be adopted in other frameworks SPA or even Web applications.

##<a name="Overview"></a>Overview

###<a name="Traditional-Model"></a>Traditional Model

![Communication](../dist/img/Communication.png)

In this traditional model the navigation between pages, occurred in the browser, request or send data waiting to return a new HTML to be rendered on top of the current page, even in situations where the request to stay on the same page. Usually this HTML is prepared dynamically in the web application server.

Frameworks like JSF, Spring MVC, ASP.NET MVC, django, Play, Rails, among others, use this building model.

###<a name="SPA-Model"></a>SPA Model

![SPAModel](../dist/img/SPAModel.png)

In the SPA model, the HTML page requests are smaller, are held when have a page change, though is returned static HTMLs unprepared adds the application server. Data is exchanged (sent or received from the server) through AJAX requests in REST APIs in JSON or XML format.

This model basically consists of three core technologies:
* HTML: pages or page fragment
* JavaScript: controllers and other programmatic resources
* CSS: visual stylesheet

There are some frameworks that implements this model (Ember, knockout, Backbone.js, etc), but recommended, as stated above, is to use AngularJS.

##<a name="Logic-View"></a>Logic View

![LogicStructure](../dist/img/LogicStructure.png)

In SPA applications the recommendation is the adoption of the above model, basically adopt the MVC pattern on the client side, separating and organizing code responsibility.

AngularJS already directs the construction for this MVC pattern and has components acting types in each of these layers.

###<a name="Views"></a>Views

Layer where is the implementation of the canvas and visual components. In this layer we find the following AngularJS components/resources:

* HTML/Templates
* Data Binds
* Directives
* Filters

###<a name="Controllers"></a>Controllers

Layer where is the implementation of flow controllers and navigation between screens. In this layer we find the following AngularJS components/resources:

* Controller
* Router and Location

###<a name="Services"></a>Services
Layer where is the implementation of services, with business rules (when there is no backend) or calls to the backend. In this layer we find the following AngularJS components/resources:

* Service
* Factory
* Provider

##<a name="Code-Structure"></a>Code Structure

Following is the base organization proposed for SPA projects, based on industry standards and evolved with an increase of certain individual divisions.

Base reference: https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure

###<a name="General-Resources"></a>General Resources

```
assets --> external components or code implementation is not linked to SPA
assets/libs --> external libraries (ex: angular, jquery, bootstrap, etc)
assets/css --> third-party css
assets/css/app.css --> custom css in the project (the only one that must be modified)
assets/fonts --> sources used by the project
assets/img --> images used in assembling the site/project
assets/js --> JS files not AngularJS created/customized in the project
```

This structure is used by several market components, for example, Twitter Bootstrap uses these folder paths on their CSS, to obtain images, fonts, etc.

###<a name="Foundation-Structure"></a>Foundation Structure

```
app --> SPA application components
app/app.js --> JS file with general application settings
app/common --> foundation technical module, containing general components of the app
app/common/env/common-env.js --> json file with general environment variables
app/common/i18n/resources_[en|pt|*].js --> json file with resources for i18n
app/common/components --> specialized components and resources for the project
app/common/components/[component] --> organized by component, containing js, html...
app/common/components/[component]/[component].js
app/common/components/[component]/[component].html
app/common/components/header --> layout component for create the header
app/common/components/navigation --> layout component for create the menu
app/common/features/[submodule]/[feature] --> global features/layouts common of every project
	Suggested route: /common/[submodule]/[feature]
app/common/features/auth --> glogal screens related to authentication.
app/common/features/auth/signin --> sign in screen
	Route: /common/auth/signin
app/common/features/auth/signup --> sign up screen
	Route: /common/auth/signup
```

###<a name="Module-Structure"></a>Module Structure

```
app/[module]
app/[module]/[module]-app.js --> js file with module settings
app/[module]/env/[module]-env.js --> json file with module environment variables
app/[module]/i18n/resources_[en|pt|*].js --> json file with resources for i18n
app/[module]/components/[component]/ --> specialized module components 
app/[module]/components/[component]/[component].js
app/[module]/components/[component]/[component].html
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature] --> module features/pages
	Rota recomendada: /[module]/[submodule]/[feature]
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature]-ctrl.js --> controller
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature]-service.js --> service
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature]-directive.js --> directive
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature]-filter.js --> filter
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature].html --> page
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature]/view/*.html --> if more than 1 html
```

In this template, it is proposed to separate reusable components of functional pages. Understood as components those common features or reusable mechanisms (directives, filters, interceptors in AngularJS)... Features, instead, would be the functional pages, where we have the HTML that makes up the whole page and its controller (and other pages specific resources).
The naming convention for folders and files is to use always lowercase. For js files you should always use the sulfix that indicate his type ex: myprofile-ctrl.js, myprofile-service.js, myprofile-directive.js, etc.

For components written in AngularJS, is recommended that the name has concatenation module and submodule, such as a package / namespace to prevent overlapping component names in different modules.

##<a name="Patterns-and-Restrictions"></a>Patterns and Restrictions

###<a name="General"></a>General
1. Always modify the scripts to support RequireJS, the module NodeJS or included directly in index.html. Ex.:
```javascript
(function (factory) {
    if (typeof define === 'function') {
        define(['myDep', ...], factory);
    } else {
        if (typeof module !== "undefined" && typeof exports !== "undefined" && module.exports === exports){
            module.exports = 'COMPONENT_NAME';
            require('myDep');
        }
        return factory();
    }
}(function() {
    // ...component code
}));
```

1. If you prefer, use the mechanism available in [ng-jedi-factory](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-factory) component, which performs this abstraction above implementation for encoding controllers, services, filters, directives, modal, etc.

1. Always include external dependencies using [Bower](http://bower.io/) and set it in main.js, at the shim block if the same is not coded to support RequireJS.
```shell
bower install [nome_dep] --save && grunt
```

1. Resources linked to a feature must be created in the feature folder of the structure
```javascript
app/[module]/features/[submodule*]/[feature]/[feature resources]
```

1. Components must be created in the structure below and should not be a full feature, but reusable resources in features/panels
```javascript
app/[module]/components/[component]/[component resources]
```

1. Third-party scripts should not be changed, instead try to create a new version and publish the bower, in the worst case customize and version in the assets folder **/js/**

1. Hardcoded values that represent directories or information that can be changed according to the environment, must be set in **[*module*]-**env.js of the specific module. The [ng-jedi-factory](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-factory) json component is loaded into envSettings variable and constant can be accessed as follows:
```javascript
envSettings[.module].[variable]
```

1. If there is internationalization requirements, use the mechanism [ng-jedi-i18n](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-i18n), including all text of the policy htmls [jd-i18n](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-i18n#translate) to enable later internationalization.

1. Methods, classes, variables, etc... always written in english language.

1. Methods names, parameters and variables always written using camelCase.

1. Resource name (controller, modal, service, etc.) always using PascalCase.

1. Every component/resource should use the default namespace:
```javascript
app.[module].[submodule].[feature*].[component] 
//e.g.: app.security.auth.userprofile.UserProfileCtrl
```

1. Always declare **'use strict';** at beginning of a js file

1. Names, folders and files aways should use lowercase.

1. Every AngularJS component should have the dependencies injected by name, avoid declare just the component constructor, since the minification will shorten the parameters names.

1. Use logs from the component [$log](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$log) instead of console.log.

1. Do not use the native js function *alert*, use the component [toastr](https://github.com/Foxandxss/angular-toastr) or [ng-jedi-dialogs](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-dialogs) instead, ex.: 
```javascript
toastr.success(âMessageâ); 
AlertHelper.addInfo(âMessageâ);
```

1. Every AngularJS script should be loaded by [module]-app.js of his module.

1. API's request exception should be treated by interceptors available at [$httpProvider.interceptors](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http#interceptors) component. Exceptions involving javascript failures should utilize [$exceptionHandler](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$exceptionHandler).

###<a name="Controllers"></a>Controllers

1. Naming conventions:
  1. Physical folder: app/[**module**]/features/[**submodule/***]/[**feature**]/[**feature**]-ctrl.js
  1. Controller names: app.[**module**].[**submodule/***].[**feature**].[**feature**]Ctrl
  1. Model: [**feature**]Model
  
1. The controller's body should follow the declaration order:

  - Services
```javascript
 var service = SecurityRestService.all('admin/feature');
 ```
  - Viewmodel (vm) declaration
```javascript
 var vm = this;
```

  - Model declaration and further controls variables
```javascript
 vm.featureModel = { name: null };
 vm.pageSize = 0;
```

  - Methods bindings
```javascript
 vm.filter = filter;
 vm.remove = remove;
 vm.clear = clear;
```

  - Methods executions, data loading or any other initialization execution for the page
```javascript
 loadSystems(function (systems) {
        vm.featureRegistrationModel.systems = systems;
});
```

  - Methods declarations and his statements
```javascript
 function loadSystems(success) {
        console.log('Recovering systems');
        SecurityRestService.all('admin/system').getList().then(success);
}
```

1. Controllers should not have business rules, it should be created only in API's scope.
1. Controllers should not make direct API's calls, instead it should call by the service layer.
1. Services should not be exposed by vm or other attribute, it always should pass through controller methods.
1. All page attributes related to the model should be declared in the *vm.[**feature**]Model*, ex:
```javascript
vm.featureModel = { name: null };
```
1. Controller attributes should be declared in the root of the vm, ex:
```javascript
vm.pageSize = 10;
```

###<a name="Services"></a>Services

1. Naming conventions:
  - Physical Folder: app/[**module**]/features/[**submodule/***]/[**feature**]/[**feature**]-service.js
  - Controller name: app.[**module**].[**submodule/***].[**feature**].[**feature**]Service
1. Opt for service (if it is simple services) or provider (if it is a service that require a previous configuration).
1. If the service is only for abstract the API calls, use [$resources](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/%24resource)ou [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), both abstract the CRUD operations in json object instances. With Restangular we can even call direct by controller instead of create an additional call, this approach is used in component [ng-jedi-factory](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-factory), allowing injection of a Restangular service for pre-defined URL references.
1. Are singleton components, so avoid use business variables that could overlap in parallel streams.

###<a name="Views"></a>Views

1. Naming conventions:
  - Physical folder: app/[**module**]/features/[**submodule/***]/[**feature**]/
  - Page name: [**feature**].html
1. Always built with standard HTML, with structure and css preferentially using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), without javascript and using only AngularJS directives
1. ng-repeat should always be declared using [track by](http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2556-using-track-by-with-ngrepeat-in-angularjs-1-2.htm), to avoid performance issues.
1. If you prefer, use the directive [jd-input](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-layout#jdinput) in all fields to keep the standard appearence and avoid write too much html.
1. If you prefer, you can use default grids with the directive jd-table with API pagination.
1. At page controller declaration, use alias in camelCase for the name, ex:
```javascript
ng-controller="app.framework.imports.importfiles.ImportFilesCtrl as importFilesCtrl"
```
1. Do not declare styles inside HTML elements, always use project CSS classes.
1. If it's necessary apply internationalization, use the jd-i18n directive in all HTML text elements
  ```
  <jd-i18n>Some text<jd-i18n>
  or <a jd-i18n>Some text</a>
  ```
1. Css should be created/customized only in **assets/css/app.css** file, other css are third-party. Use the processor [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate a custom css.
1. Navigation between pages should use [ngRoute](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngRoute) component.

###<a name="Directives"></a>Directives

1. Directives should be always declared with the module and submodule names, to avoid duplicates.
2. Naming Conventions:
  - Module's general directive
    - File: app/[**module**]/components/[**component**]/[**component**]-directive.js
    - Directive name: app-[**module**]-[**component**]-[**diretiva**]
  - If it's a feature.
    - File: app/[**module**]/features/[**submodule/***]/[**feature**]/[**feature**]-directives.js
    - Directive name: app-[**module**]-[**submodule/***]-[**feature**]-[**diretiva**]
1. If you use some [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) plugin for render elements or add events, always treat those events on element's destroy scope, to remove the elements added by JQuery that are not controlled by AngularJS.

###<a name="Filters"></a>Filters

1. Filters should be always declared with the module and submodule names, to avoid duplicates.
1. Naming Conventions:
  - Module's general directive
    - File: app/[**module**]/components/[**component**]/[**component**]-filter.js
    - Directive name: app[**Module**][**Component**][**Filter**]
  - If it's a feature
    - File: app/[**module**]/features/[**feature**]/[**feature**]-filters.js
    - Directive name: app[**Module**][**Submodule**][**Feature**][**Filter**]
1. Avoid nested filters, it could cause performance problems.

##<a name="Recommended-Tools"></a>Recommended Tools

###<a name="Dependency-Management"></a>Dependency Management - Bower vs NPM

1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is used as the default module manager of Node.js, meant to manage tools used support and automate development (builds, code generation, tasks and such). Is capable of generating front-end components if used with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/), but that's not encouraged because it mix web libs and backend together, and that can be messy.
  - The files from **node_modules** folder shouldn't be versioned, only the **package.json** file.
1. [Bower](http://bower.io/) is designed especifically to manage front-end packages and optimized for that, being the recommended method for the web libs in the project.
  - The files from **bower_components** folder shouldn't be versioned, only the **bower.json** file.

###<a name="Build-and-Deploy"></a>Build and Deploy

As a Task Runner tool we recomend using Grunt, as it is wildely used and has various plugins to solve many automatization problems.

In the build process it is fundamental to do the following:

- Copying files between folders. E.g.: copying files from folder *bower_components*  to *assets*, or even to generate a build folder containing only the files to deploy. 
  - use the plugin [grunt-contrib-copy](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-copy)
- Generating the config file for each environment, e.g.: *[module]-env.json*.
  - use the plugin [grunt-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-replace)
- Check syntax, errors and style in the javascript files
  - use the plugin [grunt-contrib-jshint](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint)
- Minifying/compressing files: JS, CSS, HTML and images
  - to JS, use the plugin [grunt-contrib-uglify](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify)
  - to CSS, use the plugin [grunt-contrib-cssmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-cssmin)
  - to HTML, use the plugin [grunt-contrib-htmlmin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-htmlmin)
  - to images, use the plugin [grunt-contrib-imagemin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-imagemin)
- Renaming files to avoid browsers using cache. Known  as Cache Busting
  - use the plugin [grunt-filerev](https://github.com/yeoman/grunt-filerev)
  - on the jedi generator and the demo this plugin is used together with another steps that creat a map between the original file and the "hashed" version, so it can be used with requirejs on the route mapping where a controller is dynamically loaded. The *getFileVersion* function of the [ng-jedi-factory](https://github.com/jediproject/ng-jedi-factory) component can be used to check this mapping and get the current name of the file.
- Automated test execution, protractor and karma both have grunt plugins to be executed.
- Generating CSS from SASS processors
  - use the plugin [grunt-contrib-sass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-sass)
- "Concat" of images in one single image with css classes positioning in each image, estrategy known as Compass Sprites.
  - use the plugin [grunt-contrib-compass](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass)

To help deploying, there are a few plugins that can be used, but that ultimately depends on the on the web server and how the files are goning to be transfered to it. There are plugins that works with frp connections, http post of files, and others. dentre outros.

In the develop environment, is recomended to use the NodeJs module http-server, that quickly starts a web server of static files, it has plugins to integrate with grunt. If a SASS processor is used, Compass Sprites and/or any other task that needs to run after any code change and before the browser access it, to execute tests on development, you can use the plugin [grunt-contrib-watch](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-watch).

###<a name="Automated-Tests"></a>Automated Tests

There are two testing tools recommended on the Angularjs docs. They are:

1. [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html): test runner for unity testing, uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) (test framework), [chai](http://chaijs.com/) (assertion library) and [jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write the tests.
1. [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/): framework to write end-to-end tests (e2e).

Both run a browser, load the files, execute tests and then return with the tests results.

###<a name="Code-Generation"></a>Code Generation

It is recommended that code generators are used as much as possible to reduce the time spent writting repetitive codes like:

- Standard CRUDs.
- Recurrign mechanisms.
- Project v0.

[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) is an open source project that gather together tons of generators and is extremely recomended.

- It uses a set of other tools on its workflow, like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) e [Gump](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gump) to build, [bower](http://bower.io/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage packages
- Is possible to use thirdy part generators, or even your own.

###<a name="Mocks"></a>Mocks

API Mocks are usefull to separate front and back-end development, so both can occur simultaneously.

Use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create REST services mocks, it supports routes, filtesr, slice, sort, range, full text search and relationships.

To quickly generate mocks with json-server use [json-server-init](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server-init), it has an easy to use wizard.

When it's necessary to have different responses based on input data a good alternative is to use the [apimocker](https://github.com/gstroup/apimocker).

###<a name="Debugging"></a>Debugging

In order to be possible to debug the application, it's not recommended to minify, obfuscate or group the files to build in the develop environment.

Using the Google Chrome developer tools and Firebug (to Firefox) are recommended to debug the application, they allow debugging and manipulating js and css files and also provide Networking Debugging tools.

On top of that it is also recommended the use of [AngularJS Batarang](https://github.com/angular/batarang) to look at the scope and watch contexts of angular.
